I am a Lecturer of Computer Architecture in the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Prishtina. I received my PhD in High Performance Computing from the University of Vienna, Austria. Besides the research focus on High Performance Computing, my area of expertise includes
software development in C/C++, parallel and high-performance paradigms, and web backend development. I have more than ten years of experience in technology consulting and software development with various companies working with the European Commission, UNDP, World Bank.
